From the lab bench 👩🏻‍🔬 to data breakthroughs 📊 – I pivoted from life science research to statistical programming for one main reason. 
#### I want to spend my career doing something that matters.
What matters most to me is seeing how my work directly improves patients’ lives.

### Hi! I’m Esther 👋, 
a Research Associate turned Statistical Programmer with a proven history of extracting meaningful insights from real-world data by developing Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs).

I love the challenge of uncovering hidden trends through programming, knowing that my work can directly drive innovative healthcare solutions. 

🔭 I’m currently working on projects that map mock CRF data into SDTM/ADaM datasets using SAS.

🌱 I’m also diving into R Shiny to create interactive visualizations — and eager to learn more about clinical reporting in R!

📫 Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-ki/) — I’d love to chat or collaborate! 

Thanks for visiting my GitHub, and have a great day!
