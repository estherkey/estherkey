From the lab bench 👩🏻‍🔬 to data breakthroughs 📊 – I pivoted from life science research to statistical programming for one main reason. 
#### I want to spend my career doing work that makes a difference.
What drives me most is knowing that my code can help improve patients’ lives.

### Hi! I’m Esther 👋, 
a Research Associate turned Statistical Programmer with a proven history of extracting meaningful insights from real-world data by developing Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs).

I love the challenge of uncovering hidden trends through programming, knowing that my work can directly drive innovative healthcare solutions. 

👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on enhancing my programming skills through various personal and collaborative projects. I'm diving into data visualization, data processing (including extraction and manipulation), and predictive modeling using both R and SAS. I'm also working on projects that map mock CRF data into SDTM/ADaM datasets using SAS.

🌱 I’m also diving into R Shiny to create interactive visualizations — and eager to learn more about clinical reporting in R!
